In one of the letters addressed to Rodríguez Feo from Argentina, Virgilio Piñera reminds him to be careful about misspellings and errata. Piñera was especially concerned because it was something he felt was taken much more seriously in Argentina and he wanted his magazine, Ciclón, to cement his fame there. There were a few in the editions that were printed, not very many all told because it was only 4 or 5 numbers. The literary world didn't exactly open up to him either. The errata may have had something to do with that, but probably not due to the literary quality of the magazine. It seems that the limitations of a smaller intellectual industry is pressed into the very pages it produces.



Form and content are bound up in **Levittown mon amour**,  by Cezanne Cardona Morales. The characters of the short story collection are wading through misery, drug addiction, poverty, failed marriage and questionable parenting. Sometimes everything goes horribly wrong at the end. Others, there's a smile that's only possible to read when you've looked at the same empty water tower and riden in discontinued cars. 



There's a slow rhythm to their movements that mirrors the lagging behind of the neighborhood that they inhabit. Yet, they are there, looking for someone that maybe doesn't want to see them, and still they keep going. Trying to move past a series of mistakes that are clear to them now. It's not a cynical book or a fatalistic vision of these lives. Rather, it's a record of their existence. Proof that in that place, these people lived. 



And so are the errata. In Spanish the plural add an 's' to the word, in English the singular is the same as the singular in Spanish. To find it English you have to use another language where it originally meant *wander* or *erred*. Those oversights are contradictory in that they are a comforting reminder that these books still exist, even in a world that requires a preface to explain that it doesn't draw its inspiration in any way from the suffering of the hurricanes.
