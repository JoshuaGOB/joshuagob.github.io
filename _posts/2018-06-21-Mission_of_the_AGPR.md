**Responsibilities and Benefits**

As the holder of resources, the Archive would simply keep its current practices of allowing researchers to come into their collections. They already have a system for verifying copyrighted material and legal use for research and publication purposes. However, the Archive will connect all of these researchers which may not know or collaborate with each other. The **biggest hurdle** for the Archive could be activating and organizing their own network, while expanding it to include traditional researchers, students, amateur researchers and the curious public. The most important benefit for the Archive is public awareness. Their mission statement is:

> ![biblioteca_historica]({{ "images/biblioteca_historica_de_pr.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: style="display: block; margin-left:auto; float: right"}  *to preserve, promote, research and divulge the Puerto Rican Culture in its complex diversity.  As per the memory and promise of culture, the various levels, sectors, age groups and interests of the community create the aggregate of life styles, customs, and artistic manifestations that define us as a nation.  The IPRC exists to preserve and divulge these lore, make known our talent in the international community and enrich our respect.* The project and the AGPR expands on the original definitions of preservation, promotion, research and dissemination by embracing these goals in their current form.
