**Translating limitations into engagement**

The AGPR is in an amazing place. Seriously.

There's one of the largest municipal parks across the street and a beach beyond that. To the Northwest is the colonial city of Old San Juan. But this is not a tourism add. Instead, what this means is that there's a vibrant community and foot traffic that could be utilizing the AGPR. Yet, they're not. Partly, because it's used more as an intimidating museum:

and also because their budget is mainly for preservation of materials in a climate that is **anathema** to these efforts. However, the AGPR is still used by people, mainly researchers, for their own intellectual work. What would happen if we could make a version of that work available for the public?
