**What's an archive and why do we care**

The General Archive of Puerto Rico was established by law in 1955 and officialy inaugurated in 1972. Over that period, the building was renovated, having previously been a hospital, jail and tobacco factory. The AGPR is under the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture but it's main function has been to preserve the textual production of every government entity on the Island.

<u>This sounds super boring</u>

Except, among those papers are the FBI disinformation files manufactured against insurrectionists from 1950 to 1970. There's also more than 13,000 music scores because the Philarmonic and Symphonic Orchestras are public corporations, which means that the holdings go back to as early as 1712. You can also find the slave records and a copy of the first constitution of Puerto Rico.

<u>Still not super interesting, right?</u>

Well, that's the issue with archives and specially paper based archives. You really need to see it to get into it. And that's what this is all about.
