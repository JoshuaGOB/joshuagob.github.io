**Getting stuff out and people in**

The AGPR is in an amazing place. Seriously.

There's one of the largest municipal parks across the street and a beach beyond that. To the Northwest is the colonial city of Old San Juan. But this is not a tourism add. Instead, what this means is that there's a vibrant community and foot traffic that could be utilizing the AGPR. Yet, they're not. Partly, because it's used more as an intimidating museum:

and also because their budget is mainly for preservation of materials in a climate that is **anathema** to these efforts.
