**Why data, why?**

There's a reason for all the work that went into a Jekyll site, although 3-4 days should be enough to get anyone up and running with a basic site.
Static website generators like Jekyll don't require a browser to load all of the contents of a webpage every single time you open it. This makes
the website much faster and slimmer, which is incredibly important in places where their is slow or intermittent connectivity. If we think of that
restricted connectivity as a digital version of the access to a traditional archive, there appears to be a parallel that works against preservation and
use of the resources in contexts where economic resources are limited.

Jekyll circumvents this, partially at least, by making websites that don't need a server, load in every device, don't require a minimum browser and
can be hosted locally or remotely. This entire site can be loaded onto a USB drive, copied, distributed and modified; and it will still work.
