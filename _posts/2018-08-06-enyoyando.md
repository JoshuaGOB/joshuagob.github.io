Two hundred odd dollars, five or six daily hours of DIYing, un despojo, and a week later the apartment starts to look decent. Everything hurts from the carpet cleaning machine, to the wallpaper ripping and paiting. There's also a pathetically insulting email in my draft folder addressed to the previous tenant. Then again, who doesn't like to yell into the void.

But maybe it's better to simply hold on to this feeling of contentment from not giving up even when it was too much. Gut feelings be damned when you have a lazy and impatient disposition. Now it's just a matter of recovering the work routine and adding the academic/dh stuff with a bit of exercise.

I spent all day on the blog and now it's sort of up and running for my purposes. Anyhow, tinkering is beyond me now. Although a daily count would be excellent.
