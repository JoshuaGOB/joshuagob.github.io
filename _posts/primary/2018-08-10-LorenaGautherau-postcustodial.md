When looking at post-custodial archive proposals and projects, albeit in an uninformed fashion, I didn't consider the implications it could have for something that I will awkwardly call "ethically committed research" in the literature/cultural studies fields. Lorena Gautherau says that the post-custodial model is often applied to "minority archives" and that it's meant to revert some effects of colonialism as well as decisions by bigger institutions that negatively affect the archive (closing it off by custody or selling due to low estimation). Sometimes the conversations about the archives among my classmate has a tinge of this power structure when we discuss the Benson vis-à-vis Archivo General de Puerto Rico or Archivo General de la Nación de México. Amazement in the plenitude of resources versus vexation over real and perceived frustrations.

They all have some superficially noticeable issues. The first is in a city that is gentrifying at an alarming rate and mainly at the expense of residents related to or coming from the cultures which created the cultural products that are preserved there. The second seems to be a forgotten past that neither the government nor the researchers quite know what to make of or how to use it in support of their aims. The third sits in one of the most notorious prisons in México, which can be taken as a warning or a literal barrier created by another state power that has routinely abused the truth. None of these descriptions are about the actual archival documents but everything around it that is also a part of it.

They prioritize those types of archives in our department. I assume that it's out of the value that they hold in accordance to ethical research practices that are committed to the cultures and peoples that they research. But it's also partially due to novelty and the value that has on our academic system and the prestige of the new. That still leaves the question about whether the post-custodial model should inform traditional humanistic research (or any version in reality) and if so, should it be among the first considerations in building research projects or top of the list for archives to start with? Should I be actively seeking out opportunities to build the technical end for those archives and promoting funding proposals and post-custodial engagements through my institution?

Maybe the hardest part of working with any archive and what @LGauth19 calls "minority archives" is figuring out what role is already established for me as a researcher, what it should be and if it matches what it actually is.

Overall, great introduction to some of those questions and concerns.
