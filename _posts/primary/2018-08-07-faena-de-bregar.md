Working in an academic library has been a fascinating experience. Mainly because everyone is so freaking weird, constantly, and super nice. The head pos-custodial archivist brought back a cardboard book from an independent publisher from Nicaragua and a chocolate bar. The book deserves more space here, but the amazing thing about the whole event was that translating some brief texts is received with such gratefulness. The effect is that my time feels valued and I feel part of this small community that I've mainly experienced in awkward hellos, graciously received interruptions of hyper-focused individuals and a large amount of awe for the work that they do.

Today was a solid example of this with Albert, head of the DS Office, and Jennifer Isasi, new CLIR post-doc, bringing me in to a planning meeting for a course on archives, borderlands and digital methods. I'll get to teach Recogito, a tool that I know the fundamentals of but that I still need to figure out for the purposes of a larger research project. But really, the most valuable learning experience is seeing how a course comes together, the nuts and bolts, as well as the bigger scheme pedagogical aspects that they are considering. On top of this are the considerations of the use of final projects from undergraduates as something that they can put on their CV, so quality has to justify hosting in the institutional repository, and how their work can also promote, enhance and increase access to collections. Sometimes the goals are in conflict: like wanting to translate final projects or 18th century manuscripts so that target audiences (high school classes) and non Spanish speaking UT classes could use them, even though translation for upper division students may be difficult and time consuming or simply problematic because it's not a translation course and so translation studies theory should be a part of the potential analysis that they do. The last one being even more relevant considering the nature of the course, its materials and the themes of indigenous peoples. Let's see what the end product is. It seems everyone involved is flexible enough to shift some of these points without undermining the objectives of the course.

This thing is so cool. I like the idea of having the whole book in loose pages and then placing them inside a single cover page that has cutouts simulating author bio and the he publisher's info on the outside. And if it's a series it can be used for multiple books.
